Here, I've decided to begin my AI and DS Learning Journey starting from the very basics. I've known a few things initially and am familiar with others, but i've still decided to make it beginner-friendly!

Funnily enough, the first thing I had to learn was how to make a proper [Markdown] (this) file so the content down below should look super easy to follow and professional! 

Enjoy!
