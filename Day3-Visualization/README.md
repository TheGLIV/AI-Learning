# Day 3: Data Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn

Today, I learned practical skills in the python plotting libraries — **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

---


### Matplotlib Basics
- Plotted **line graphs**, **bar charts**, and **histograms**.
- Understood how to make and customize plots

### Seaborn
- Created advanced visualizations like **countplots**, **boxplots**, **violin plots**, and **heatmaps**.
- Used `sns.pairplot()` for exploring relationships between numeric stuff.
- Learned how to group and plot aggregate data using `groupby()`

### Correlation Analysis
- Used `.corr()` to compute correlation between numerical columns.
- Plotted **correlation heatmaps**

## Saved Visualization Charts 

I saved key charts as `.png`,`jpg` files to reuse.

Check out the `charts` folder.

## Final thoughts

This day helped me:
- Really "see" the data — patterns, outliers, and insights.
- Appreciated visuals of data.
